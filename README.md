This is a game engine written in Java using the LWJGL3 library.

Author's Note: I undertook this project for two reasons. One, to learn the Java programming language, and two, to build games. 

Note: The java classes themselves are accompanied by an "rsc" resource folder. In here you may find some files with questionable names. One of the games I attempted to emulate was Wolfenstein 3D.
